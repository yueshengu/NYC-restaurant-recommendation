# Project 2 Open Data NYC

In this second project of W4249 Applied Data Science, we will carry out *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* via a shiny app on a topic about open data released from the [New York City open data portal](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/). See [Project 2 Description](project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The learning goals for this project is 
- exploratory data analysis
- visualization
- shiny app
- app production work flow

Link to our app: https://yueshengu.shinyapps.io/nycRestaurantShiny/

Our app focuses on recommending the best NYC restaurants around your current location. Given a short expression describing your location (ie. Columbia University), our app will fetch the longitude and latitude from Google, show your location on a leaflet map as well as nearby restuarants that match your taste. If you click on a restaurant, our app will scrape data from Yelp and show its detailed info on the side of the map.
